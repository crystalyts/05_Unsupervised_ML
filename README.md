# 05_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning

This project focuses on utilizing the Scikit-Learn library to scale data and apply K-means clustering to create clusters of songs. These clusters are then used to automatically generate playlists.

## Data

A dataset that has been collected from the Spotify API and contains the audio features (tempo, energy, danceability…) for a few thousand songs.

- Step 1 Data preparation:
  - Reading the data
  - Initial quick exploration
  - Dropping unwanted song features

- Step 2 Modelling:
  - Data scaling (potentially, other transformations)
  - K-Means exploration of clusters (elbow method, silhouette coefficient…)
  - K-Means final model

## Results
9 playlists (clusters) are created with similar mood and uploaded to Spotify.
